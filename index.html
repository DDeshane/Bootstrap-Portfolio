                    <p>My name is Dinah Deshane, I was born and raised in New Hampshire. 
                       I relocated to Vermont for several years, and then retuned to New Hampshire to raise a family of my own. 
                       I have two adorable kids, just ask them, and they will tell you that themselves. 
                       Landon is my oldest, named after Landon Donavan from the US 2010 World Cup team. 
                       He loves sports, and hopes to be a soccer star himself one day. 
                       Avery is my youngest, and the reason I started to turn gray this year. 
                       She loves dancing, dressing up, makeup, and being dramatic. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I started off my college career in Burlington, VT at Champlain college, and then transferred to UNH.
                       I graduated with a degree in communications. I then went on to work to work at John Hancock for 11 years. 
                       I worked in many arears through my tenure and ended up handling contracting and registrations for John Hancock’s Broker Dealer Signator. 
                       This summer we were bought out by another company, and my job at John Hancock was coming to an end. 
                       I saw this an opportunity to try something new and signed up for UNH coding bootcamp.

                    <p> I have been around this industry my whole life. My father was a computer programer, and my hero. 
                        While he is no longer here, I think he would be very proud of my decision to make this change in my career. 
                        My husband is also a web developer, and has always enjoyed going to work. 
                        However, that might be because of the beer cart on-site.
                        I’ve always been around this industry, and look forward to contributing to it myself now.
